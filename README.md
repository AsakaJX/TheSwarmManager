# "TheSwarmManager" - this is bot that I created specifically for my Discord server.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Should be manually builded. Also it's possibly not going to work rn.
> Maybe I'll revisit this bot later and make it more understandable to work with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Requirements: *coming soon*

## Feautures that I implemented:
1. All core functions that all music-bots have with low loading times thanks to [Victoria](https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria).
2. Integrated StableDiffusion AI to generate images with ability to: input custom prompt + negative prompt, choose custom size, model, upscaling.
3. Integrated ChatGPT AI (it doesn't remember previous messages at the moment)
4. Integrated VoiceVox AI to generate female speech in Japanese language (it was used to: generate custom phrases and play them in voice channel, generate response from chat gpt as audio and then play it in voice channel)
5. Custom "Slots" game, that had various prizes and in-text-animation of each reel being randomized. (it also had a system to bypass rng and make some prizes drop more ofter :))
5.1. WIP: inventory system, money system
5.2. WIP DONE: stats system
6. ðŸ˜Ž Cool ðŸ˜Ž logging system
7. Added (for some reason) password checker from db on launch; if incorrect - bot not launches (might remove it later)
7.1. Password saved as hash, so all good :)
8. Other misc commands, too lazy to list all of them
